# Nexus Proof System

The second main component of the Nexus zkVM is the Nexus Proof System, which provides proofs of correctness for any computation being run on the Nexus VM. In order to realize this goal and be able to support arbitrarily large computations, the Nexus Proof System relies on modern recursive zero-knowledge proof systems such as folding and accumulation schemes [[KST22; KS22; BC23](#references)] to achieve a high level of parallelization.

Let $P$ be a program that has been compiled to the Nexus VM, possibly with access to co-processors.  The proof generation process for $P$ has four main steps: 
1. Nexus zkVM initialization;
2. Program execution;
3. Proof accumulation; and
4. Proof compression.

The following subsections provide an overview of each of these  components.

## Initialization

Let $P$ be a program which we want to execute in a verifiable manner. As described above, before loading $P$ into the memory starting at address $\mathtt{0x0000}$, the Nexus VM initially sets the contents of its global-purpose registers to 0 and the value of each memory location is assumed to be undefined. 

In order to enforce the consistency of the memory throughout the execution of the program $P$, the Nexus zkVM currently uses Merkle Trees [[M87](#references)] for memory checking together with the Poseidon hash function [[GKR21](#references)]. In this method, we compute a Merkle root associated with the current contents of the memory and we update its value whenever the contents of the memory change.

Once the Merkle Root for the initial state is computed, the Nexus zkVM starts loading the program $P$ one instruction at a time, updating the Merkle Tree Root accordingly after each memory update. 

Finally, once $P$ is fully loaded into the memory, we use the Merkle Root for the current state of the memory as the public input to the execution step of the proof system.

## Program execution

After receiving a Merkle proof from the initialization step with a Merkle proof for the initial memory state with the program loaded at address $\mathtt{0x0000}$, the Nexus zkVM runs the program on the Nexus VM and generates a full execution trace for it. This execution trace is then passed to the proof accumulation step, as indicated in the following diagram, where each step $F$ denotes one step of the Nexus VM.

## Proof accumulation

In order to enable a high-level of parallelization without impacting the efficiency of the scheme, the Nexus zkVM uses proof accumulation (without SNARKs), represented by the IVC step in the diagram above. The main advantage of using such a scheme is that it realizes the notion of Incrementally Verifiable Computation (IVC) [[Val08](#references)] and its Proof-Carrying Data (PCD) [[CT10](#references)] generalization to the distribued setting.

### Nova folding scheme

In the current version of the Nexus zkVM, this step makes use of the *Nova* folding scheme [[KST22](#references)] over a cycle of elliptic curves. At a high level, *Nova* provides a method to prove correctness of a repeated computation $F^{(n)}(z) = F(F(F(\ldots F(z))))$ by reducing this claim to a claim about the correctness of a *single* invocation of $F$, where $F$ is encoded using a generalized version of the Rank 1 Constraint System, called *Relaxed* R1CS.  In the context of the Nexus zkVM, one can think of $F$ as representing the state transition corresponding to a single machine instruction of the Nexus VM and $z$ as representing the state of the machine's memory and registers, as well as the program itself.

One main advantage of using *Nova* is that it has a small recursion overhead, which denotes the number of steps that a prover must prove in addition to proving an invocation of $F$ [[KST22](#references)]. In particular, when used to realize an IVC scheme, Nova's recursion overhead is dominated by *two group scalar multiplications* and three hash computations. When used within a PCD, this overhead is slightly higher but still reasonable.

In terms of prover costs, the most expensive part of the prover's work at the each folding step is to compute *two multi-scalar multiplications* (MSMs) of size proportional to the size of $F$. This is because the prover needs to commit to two large witness vectors at each folding step using a Pedersen commitment scheme. Despite being the most computationally expensive part of the proof generation, this computation is highly parallelizable.

### Cycles of curves

One difficulty that arises in the Nova implementation is that the group scalar multiplications used in the recursive step involve operations over a field that is different than the native field used by the proof system. Hence, as mentioned above, the [Nova reference implementation](https://github.com/microsoft/Nova) by Microsoft uses a *cycle of elliptic curves* to reduce the number of non-native arithmetic operations and improve its overall efficiency, This is a well-known technique introduced in [[BCTV14](#references)] to improve the efficiency of elliptic-curve-based SNARK recursions. In a $2$-_cycle_ of elliptic curves $(\mathbb{G}_1, \mathbb{G}_2)$, the size of the _base field_ of one curve equals the _scalar field_ (i.e., group order) of the other curve, and vice-versa.

In a nutshell, Microsoft's reference implementation for Nova works by creating two parallel copies of the IVC chain linked together in a way that allows the recursive step of one IVC chain to be verified on the other chain using native elliptic curve arithmetic operations. As shown in [[KST22](#references)], this results in a largely symmetric scheme with a recursion overhead in the order of $20{,}000$ constraints in each of the curves. Though the Nova reference implementation can work over most cycles of curves, its current implementation uses the [`pasta` cycle](https://github.com/zcash/pasta_curves) of two curves.

Thus, one consequence of using Nova over a cycles of curves is that the proof system ends up producing a pair of proofs instead of a single one. Hence, in order to verify a Nova proof, one needs to check instances over *two different* group-field pairs $(\mathbb{G}_1, \mathbb{F}_1)$ and $(\mathbb{G}_2, \mathbb{F}_2)$, where $\mathbb{F}_i$ is the scalar field of $\mathbb{G}_i$.

### `bn254`-`grumpkin` curve cycle

In order to be able to produce proofs that can be cheaply verified on Ethereum, the Nexus zkVM currently implements the Nova folding scheme using the pairing-friendly [`bn254`](https://neuromancer.sk/std/bn/bn254) as the primary curve, since the latter has precompile support on Ethereum. Moreover, since `bn254` forms a $2$-cycle along with the [`grumpkin`](https://hackmd.io/@aztec-network/ByzgNxBfd#2-Grumpkin---A-curve-on-top-of-BN-254-for-SNARK-efficient-group-operations) curve, `grumpkin` is used as the secondary curve.

Interestingly, choosing `bn254` as the primary curve by itself is not enough to achieve cheap verification on Ethereum. For that, it is also important that later phases of the proof system, such as the compression phase, only require elliptic-curve operations on `bn254`. Unfortunately, this means that the IVC verifier on the second curve will need to be emulated using non-native elliptic-curve arithmetic operations over the primary curve. 

Hence, unlike Microsoft's reference implementation, the Nexus zkVM follows the approach proposed by CycleFold [[KS23](#references)] in its implementation of Nova to address concerns about non-native elliptic-curve arithmetic operations in later phases of the proof system. In this approach, instead of duplicating the IVC chain in both curves, the circuit implemented over the second curve is only used to perform a single group scalar multiplication over the base field of the first curve. Moreover, this is done in a way that allows the verifier in the first curve to avoid non-native arithmetic operations by verifiably delegating its group scalar multiplications to the second curve.

Besides not having to reason about the 2-cycle of elliptic curves in the security proof of Nova [[KS23](#references)], one important advantage of CycleFold's approach over the one used in Microsoft's reference implementation is that the circuit size over the secondary curve becomes significantly smaller. More concretely, the size of the IVC verifier of the Nexus zkVM on the secondary curve is in the order of $3{,}000$ constraints.

The reduction in circuit complexity over the secondary curve has, however, implications on the size of the IVC verifier over the primary curve since the latter circuit now needs to keep track of additional witnesses and to perform several additional small multi-scalar multiplications and hashing operations related to these witnesses. More concretely, the recursion overhead over the primary curve is in the order of $70{,}000$ constraints when used to realize an IVC scheme and $200{,}000$ constraints when used to realize an PCD scheme.

## Proof compression

Despite being highly parallelizable, the accumulated proof generated in the IVC phase is quite large, which is undesirable in practice. Besides their sizes, such proofs are also not easily verifiable by other systems. For these reasons, the final step of the proof generation is to compress the accumulated proof with a sequence of succinct (zero-knowledge) Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge or (zk)-SNARKs for short.
