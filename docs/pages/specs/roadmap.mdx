## Nexus Roadmap

The Nexus zkVM and Nexus Network are both undergoing rapid development.

Contribute or follow along with the latest updates to the system on [Github](https://github.com/nexus-xyz/nexus-zkvm).

### v1.0 to v2.0 to Beyond
This documentation is for the Nexus 1.0. Many improvements to individual components are incoming, and will be featured on the Nexus zkVM 2.0. Expected improvements include:
1. **Prover**: A new IVC system upgraded from Nova to HyperNova.
2. **Proof Compression**: A second phase of proof compression, on top of the v1.0 $O(log(n))$ proof compression mechanism, which will bring the proof to $O(log(log(n)))$. That is, a proof of a proof of a proof.
3. **NVM**: A revised NVM architecture, with a simpler ISA, and an improved compiler toolchain with further prover-related compiler optimizations.
4. **Improved Precompile System**: A new library of Nexus precompiles, with in-depth guides showing how to write precompiles in R1CS, Plonkish and AIR.
5. **Memory checking**: An upgraded memory checking mechanism that is exponentially more performant than Merkle Trees, based on permutation checks and instruction sorting.
6. **Modularized compiler**: A modularized compiler toolchain that will break the Nexus compiler into smaller tools, that developers can use and extend to add support for new ISAs and languages.
