### Prove custom profiles

`cargo nexus prove` accepts `--profile` argument to build and prove artifact in specified profile.
The default is `release`. You can define your own profile in `Cargo.toml` of your Nexus project according
to [cargo docs](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/profiles.html). As an example, try proving debug
build:

```shell
cargo nexus prove --profile=dev
```

### Switching Nova implementation

`nexus-nova` provides two implementations of the prover: sequential and proof-carrying data. The second one is also aliased as parallel
or distributed. It enables multiple provers to work on the same program in parallel, at the cost of bigger recursion overhead (see [module docs](https://github.com/nexus-xyz/nexus-zkvm/blob/main/nova/src/circuits/nova/pcd/mod.rs) for details). 
The default one you have tried in the quick start is sequential, to switch to parallel you can either pass it as a cli argument:

```shell
cargo nexus prove --impl=par
cargo nexus verify --impl=par # don't forget to specify it for the verifier!
```

Or simply set the environment variable:

```shell
export NEXUS_VM_NOVAIMPL=par # default is seq

cargo nexus prove
cargo nexus verify
```

> Changing this value requires generating new public parameters!

### Configuring `k`

The `k` number denotes how many NexusVM instructions are batched into each prover step. Increasing this number reduces the overall number of proving steps, while also increases
the overhead of computing one, as well as the size of the final proof. Similarly to the previous section, you can either pass it through cli or environment:

```shell
cargo nexus prove -k=32
cargo nexus verify -k=32 # don't forget to specify it for the verifier!
```

or

```shell
export NEXUS_VM_K=32

cargo nexus prove
cargo nexus verify
```

> Changing this value requires generating new public parameters!

### Caching public parameters

The first time you prove a new project, `cargo nexus` sets up public parameters and stores them into `./target/nexus-cache` directory. If you want to re-use it
or replace this path with something else, set the environment variable:

```shell
export NEXUS_CACHE=/tmp/nexus

cargo nexus prove
```
