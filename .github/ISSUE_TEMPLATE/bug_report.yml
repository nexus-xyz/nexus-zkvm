        **Before You Start...**

        This form is only for submitting bug reports. If you have a usage question
        or are unsure if this is really a bug, make sure to:

        - Read the [docs](https://github.com/nexus-xyz/nexus-zkvm)
        - Ask on [Telegram Chat](https://t.me/nexus_zkvm)
        - Ask on [Github Discussions](https://github.com/nexus-xyz/nexus-zkvm/discussions)

        Also try to search for your issue - it may have already been answered or even fixed in main or a development branch but not yet released.

        However, if you find that an old, closed issue still persists in the latest version, you should open a new issue using the form below instead of commenting on the old issue.
