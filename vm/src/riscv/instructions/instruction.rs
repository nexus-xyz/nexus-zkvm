//! This module defines the instruction types and decoding for RISC-V RV32IM instructions.
//!
//! It includes the `Instruction` struct, which represents a unified form for all instruction types,
//! and the `InstructionDecoder` struct, which implements the `InstructionProcessor` trait to decode
//! various RISC-V instruction formats.
//!
