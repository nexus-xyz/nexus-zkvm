## Module Interactions

The RISC-V emulator is designed with a modular architecture, allowing for clear separation of concerns and efficient interaction between components. Here's an overview of how the key modules interact:

1. ELF Loading and Parsing:
   - The `elf::loader` module parses the ELF file, extracting program data, instructions, and memory images.
   - It populates the `ElfFile` struct with this information, which serves as the initial state for the emulator.

2. Instruction Decoding:
   - The `riscv::decoder` module takes raw instruction data from the `ElfFile` and decodes it into `Instruction` objects.
   - It also organizes instructions into basic blocks for efficient execution.

3. Memory Management:
   - The `memory` module provides a unified interface for different memory types (`fixed`, `variable`) and access modes (`RO`, `WO`, `RW`, `NA`).
   - Both `HarvardEmulator` and `LinearEmulator` in `emulator::executor` use this module to manage program memory, data memory, and I/O operations.

4. CPU State Management:
   - The `cpu` module maintains the CPU state, including registers and the program counter.
   - The `emulator::executor` interacts with this module to update CPU state during instruction execution.

5. Instruction Execution:
   - The `emulator::executor` module is the central component that orchestrates the execution process:
     - It retrieves instructions and memory images from the `ElfFile`.
     - Uses the `riscv::decoder` to interpret instructions.
     - Employs a basic block cache for optimized execution.
     - Executes instructions, updating the `cpu::Cpu` state and performing memory operations via the `memory` module.
     - Handles system calls by interfacing with the `system::syscall` module.

6. System Calls:
   - The `system::syscall` module handles system-level operations.
   - It's invoked by the `emulator::executor` when a syscall instruction is encountered.
   - Interacts with the `cpu` module to access and modify CPU state, and with the `memory` module for I/O operations.

7. Memory Layout and Optimization:
   - The `emulator::layout` module defines the memory layout used by the `LinearEmulator`.
   - The `emulator::memory_stats` module tracks memory usage and helps optimize the memory layout based on runtime behavior.

8. Instruction Registry:
   - The `emulator::registry` module manages the mapping between opcodes and their execution functions.
   - It allows for runtime extension of the instruction set, including custom instructions.

9. Emulator State Capture:
   - The `emulator::mod` module provides the `View` struct, which captures the final state of the emulator after execution.
   - This allows for analysis and debugging of the emulated program's behavior.

This architecture facilitates easier maintenance, testing, and future enhancements to the RISC-V emulator.
